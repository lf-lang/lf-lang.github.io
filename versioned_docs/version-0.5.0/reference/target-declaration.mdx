import {
  LanguageSelector,
  NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock,
  ShowIf, ShowIfs, ShowOnly,
} from '@site/src/components/LinguaFrancaMultiTargetUtils';

<LanguageSelector c cpp py rs ts />

Every Lingua Franca program begins with a statement of this form:

```lf
    target <name> <parameters>
```

The `<name>` gives the name of some Lingua Franca target language, which is the language in which reactions are written. This is also the language of the program(s) generated by the Lingua Franca compiler. The target languages currently supported are C, C++, Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

# Summary of Parameters

A target specification may have optional parameters, the names and values of which depend on which specific target you are using. Each parameter is a key-value pair, where the supported keys are a subset of the following:

- [**auth**](#auth): A boolean specifying to apply authorization between RTI and federates when federated execution.
- [**build**](#build): A command to execute after code generation instead of the default compile command.
- [**build-type**](#build-type): One of Release (the default), Debug, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
- [**cargo-dependencies**](#cargo-dependencies): (Rust only) list of dependencies to include in the generated Cargo.toml file.
- [**cargo-features**](#cargo-features): (Rust only) List of string names of features to include.
- [**cmake**](#cmake): Whether to use cmake for building.
- [**cmake-include**](#cmake): List of paths to cmake files to guide compilation.

- [**export-dependency-graph**](#export-dependency-graph): To export the reaction dependency graph as a dot graph (for debugging).
- [**fast**](#fast): A boolean specifying to execute as fast as possible without waiting for physical time to match logical time.
- [**files**](#files): An array of paths to files or directories to be copied to the directory that contains the generated sources.
- [**flags**](#flags): An arrays of strings giving options to be passed to the target compiler.
- [**logging**](#logging): An indicator of how much information to print when executing the program.
- [**no-compile**](#no-compile): If true, then do not invoke a target language compiler. Just generate code.
- [**no-runtime-validation**](#no-runtime-validation): If true, disable runtime validation.
- [**protobufs**](#protobufs): An array of .proto files that are to be compiled and included in the generated code.
- [**runtime-version**](#runtime-version): Specify which version of the runtime system to use.
- [**rust-include**](#rust-include): (Rust only) A set of Rust modules in the generated project.
- [**scheduler**](#scheduler): (C only) Specification of the scheduler to us.
- [**single-file-project**](#single-file-project): (Rust only) If true, enables [single-file project layout](#single-file-layout).

Not all targets support all target parameters. The full set of target parameters supported by the target is:

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock lf 
c={
`target C {

    workers: <non-negative integer>,
};`
} 
cpp={
`target Cpp {
    build-type: <Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo, or MinSizeRel>,

<ShowOnly c>

For example:

```lf-c
target C {
    cmake: false,
    compiler: "cc",
    flags: "-O3",
    fast: true,
    logging: log,
    timeout: 1 secs,
};
```

This specifies to use compiler `cc` instead of the default `gcc`, to use optimization level 3, to execute as fast as possible, and to exit execution when logical time has advanced to 10 seconds. Note that all events at logical time 10 seconds greater than the starting logical time will be executed.

</ShowOnly>

The comma on the last parameter is optional, as is the semicolon on the last line.
A target may support overriding the target parameters on the [command line](#command-line-arguments) when invoking the compiled program.

## auth

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c>
The detailed documentation is [here](../reference/security.mdx).
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp py ts rs>
This target does not currently support the `auth` target option.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## build

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c>
A command to execute after code generation instead of the default compile command. This is either a single string or an array of strings. The specified command(s) will be executed an environment that has the following environment variables defined:

- `LF_CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY`: The directory in which the command is invoked.
- `LF_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`: The directory containing the .lf file being compiled.
- `LF_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY`: The directory for the root of the project or package (normally the directory above the `src` directory).
- `LF_SOURCE_GEN_DIRECTORY`: The directory in which generated files are placed.
- `LF_BIN_DIRECTORY`: The directory into which to put binaries.

The command will be executed in the same directory as the `.lf` file being compiled. For example, if you specify

```lf-c
target C {
    build: "./compile.sh Foo"
}
```

then instead of invoking the C compiler after generating code, the code generator will invoke your `compile.sh` script, which could look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Build the generated code.
cd ${LF_SOURCE_GEN_DIRECTORY}
cmake .
make

# Move the executable to the bin directory.
mv $1 ${LF_BIN_DIRECTORY}

# Invoke the executable.
${LF_BIN_DIRECTORY}/$1

# Plot the results, which have appeared in the src-gen directory.
gnuplot ${LF_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}/$1.gnuplot
open $1.pdf
```

The first few lines of this script do the same thing that is normally done when there is no `build` option in the target. Specifically, they use `cmake` to create a makefile, invoke `make`, and then move the executable to the `bin` directory. The next line, however, gives new functionality. It executes the compiled code! The final two lines assume that the program has produced a file with data to be plotted and use `gnuplot` to plot the data. This requires, of course, that you have `gnuplot` installed, and that there is a file called `Foo.gnuplot` in the same directory as `Foo.lf`. The file `Foo.gnuplot` contains the commands to plot the data, and might look something like the following:

```gnuplot
set title 'My Title'
set xrange [0:3]
set yrange [-2:2]
set xlabel "Time (seconds)"
set terminal pdf size 5, 3.5
set output 'Foo.pdf'
plot 'mydata1.data' using 1:2 with lines, \
     'mydata2.data' using 1:2 with lines
```

This assumes that your program has written two files, `mydata1.data` and `mydata2.data` containing two columns, time and value.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp py ts rs>
This target does not currently support the `build` target option.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>


## build-type

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf ts py>
This target does not currently support the `build-type` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This parameter works with `cargo` to specify how to compile the code. The following options are supported:

- `Release`: Optimization is turned on and debug information is missing.
- `Debug`: Debug information is included in the executable.
- `RelWithDebInfo`: Optimization with debug information.
- `MinSizeRel`: Optimize for smallest size.

This defaults to `Release`.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c cpp>
This parameter works with `cmake` to specify how to compile the code. The following options are supported:

- `Release`: Optimization is turned on and debug information is missing.
- `Debug`: Debug information is included in the executable.
- `RelWithDebInfo`: Optimization with debug information.
- `MinSizeRel`: Optimize for smallest size.

This defaults to `Release`.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>


## cargo-dependencies

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c cpp py ts >
This target does not support the `cargo-dependencies` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This is a list of dependencies to include in the generated Cargo.toml file. The value of this parameter is a map of package name to _dependency-spec_.

Here is an example for defining dependencies:

```lf-rs
target Rust {
    cargo-dependencies: {
        fxhash: {
            version: "0.2.1",
        },
        rand: {
            version: "0.8",
            features: ["small_rng"],
        },
    }
};
```

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## cargo-features

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c cpp py ts >
This target does not support the `cargo-features` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This is a list of features of the generated crate. Supported are:

- "cli" - enable [command-line argument parsing](#command-line-arguments)

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## cmake

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf py rs ts>
This target does not support the `cmake` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
The C++ target does not support the `cmake` target option because it always uses `cmake`.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
```lf-c
target C {
    cmake: <true or false>
};
```

This will enable or disable the CMake-based build system (the default is `true`). Enabling the CMake build system will result in a `CMakeLists.txt` being generated in the `src-gen` directory. This `CMakeLists.txt` is then used when `cmake` is invoked by the LF runtime (either the `lfc` or the IDE). Alternatively, the generated program can be built manually. To do so, in the `src-gen/ProgramName` directory, run:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make
```

If `cmake` is disabled, `gcc` is directly invoked after code generation by default. In this case, additional target properties, such as [compiler](#compiler) and [flags](#flags) can be used to gain finer control over the compilation process.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>


<ShowOnly c cpp>

## cmake-include

```lf-c
target C {
    cmake-include: ["relative/path/to/foo.txt", "relative/path/to/bar.txt", ...]
};
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp {
    cmake-include: ["relative/path/to/foo.txt", "relative/path/to/bar.txt", ...]
};
```

This will optionally append additional custom CMake instructions to the generated `CMakeLists.txt`, drawing these instructions from the specified text files (e.g, `foo.txt`). The specified files are resolved using the same file search algorithm as used for the [files](#files) target parameter. Those files will be copied into the `src-gen` directory that contains the generated sources. This is done to make the generated code more portable<span class="lf-c"> (a feature that is useful in [federated execution](../writing-reactors/distributed-execution.mdx))</span>.

The cmake-include target property can be used, for example, to add dependencies on various packages (e.g., by using the [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) and [`target_link_libraries`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html) commands).

A CMake variable called `${LF_MAIN_TARGET}` can be used in the included text file(s) for convenience. This variable will contain the name of the CMake target (i.e., the name of the main reactor). For example, a `foo.txt` file can contain:

```cmake
find_package(m REQUIRED) # Finds the m library

target_link_libraries( ${LF_MAIN_TARGET} m ) # Links the m library
```

`foo.txt` can then be included by specifying it as an argument to `cmake-include`.

**Note**: For a general tutorial on finding packages in CMake, see [this](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) external documentation entry. For a list of CMake find modules, see [this](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-modules.7.html#find-modules).

The `cmake-include` parameter works in conjunction with the `import` statement. If any imported `.lf` file has `cmake-include` among its target properties, the specified text files will be appended to the current list of `cmake-include`s. These files will be resolved relative to the imported `.lf` file using the same search procedure as for the [files](#files) parameter. This helps resolve dependencies in imported reactors automatically and makes the code more modular.

<ShowOnly c>

[CMakeInclude.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/C/src/target/CMakeInclude.lf) is an example that uses this feature. A more sophisticated example of the usage of this target parameter can be found in [Rhythm.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/examples-lingua-franca/blob/main/C/src/Rhythm/Rhythm.lf). A distributed version can be found in [DistributedCMakeInclude.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/C/src/target/DistributedCMakeInclude.lf) is a test that uses this feature.

**Note**: For [federated execution](../writing-reactors/distributed-execution.mdx), both `cmake-include` and [files](#files) are kept separate for each federate as much as possible. This means that if one federate is imported, or uses an imported reactor that other federates don't use, it will only have access to `cmake-include`s and `files` defined in the main `.lf` file, plus the selectively imported `.lf` files. [DistributedCMakeIncludeSeparateCompile.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/C/src/target/DistributedCMakeIncludeSeparateCompile.lf) is a test that demonstrates this feature.

</ShowOnly>

<ShowOnly cpp>

See [`AsyncCallback.lf`](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/Cpp/src/concurrent/AsyncCallback.lf) for an example.

</ShowOnly>

</ShowOnly>

## compiler

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf ts py rs>
This target does not support the `compiler` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
This parameter is a string giving the name of the C compiler to use.
It is used only when [cmake](#cmake) is set to `false`. For example:

```lf-c
target C {
    cmake: false,
    compiler: "cc",
};
```

The `compiler` option here specifies to use `cc` rather than `gcc`.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This parameter is a string giving the name of the C++ compiler to use. Normally
CMake selects the best compiler for your system, but you can use this parameter
to point it to your preferred C++ compiler.
</ShowIf>

</ShowIfs>

## docker

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c py ts>
This option takes a boolean argument (default is `false`).

If true, a docker file will be generated in the unfederated case.

In the federated case, a docker file for each federate will be generated. A docker-compose file will also be generated for the top-level federated reactor.

</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This target does not support the `docker` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This parameter is a string giving the name of the C++ compiler to use. Normally
CMake selects the best compiler for your system, but you can use this parameter
to point it to your preferred C++ compiler.
</ShowIf>

</ShowIfs>

## external-runtime-path

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c py ts>
This target does not support the `external-runtime-path` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This option takes a string argument given a path to a pre-compiled external runtime library to use instead of the default one.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This option takes a path as string argument to a folder containing an alternative runtime crate to use instead of the default one.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## export-dependency-graph

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c py ts>
This target does not support the `export-dependency-graph` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp rs>
This parameter takes arguments `true` or `false` to specify whether the compiled binary will export its internal dependency graph as a dot graph when executed. This is a debugging utility.
<ShowOnly rs>
If a [CLI](#command-line-arguments) is generated, the target property is ignored, and the user should instead use the `--export-graph` flag of the generated program.
</ShowOnly>
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## fast

By default, the execution of a Lingua Franca program is slowed down, if necessary, so that logical time does not elapse faster than physical time. If you wish to execute the program as fast as possible without this constraint, then specify the `fast` target parameter with value `true`.

## files

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf cpp ts rs>
This target does not support the `files` option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c py>
The `files` target parameter specifies array of files or directories to be copied to the directory that contains the generated sources.

```lf-c
target C {
    files: ["file1", "file2", ...]
}
```

```lf-py
target Python {
    files: ["file1", "file2", ...]
}
```

The lookup procedure for these files and directories is as follows:

1- Search in the directory containing the `.lf` file that has the **target** directive.

2- If not found, search in `LF_CLASSPATH`.

3- If still not found, search in `CLASSPATH`.

4- If still not found, search for the file as a resource. Specifically, if a file begins with a forward slash `/`, then the path is assumed to be relative to the root directory of the Lingua Franca source tree.
<ShowOnly c>

For example, if you wish to use audio on a Mac, you can specify:

```lf-c
target C {
    files: ["/lib/C/util/audio_loop_mac.c", "/lib/C/util/audio_loop.h"]
}
```

Your preamble code can then include these files, for example:

```lf-c
preamble {=
    #include "audio_loop_mac.c"
=}
```

Your reactions can then invoke functions defined in that `.c` file.

Sometimes, you will need access to these files from target code in a reaction. For the C target (at least), the generated program will contain a line like this:

```c
    #define TARGET_FILES_DIRECTORY "path"
```

where `path` is the full path to the directory containing these files. This can be used in reactions, for example, to read those files.
</ShowOnly>
Moreover, the `files` target specification works in conjunction with the `import` statement. If a `.lf` file is imported and has designated supporting files using the `files` target parameter, those files will be resolved relative to that `.lf` file and copied to the directory that contains the generated sources. This is done to make code that imports other `.lf` files more modular. [Rhythm.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/examples-lingua-franca/blob/main/C/src/Rhythm/Rhythm.lf) is an example that demonstrates most of these features.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## flags

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf cpp py ts rs>
This target does not support the `flags` parameter.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
This parameter is a list of strings giving additional arguments to pass to the target language compiler.
It is used only when [cmake](#cmake) is set to `false`. For example:

```lf-c
target C {
    cmake: false,
    flags: ["-g", "-I/usr/local/include", "-L/usr/local/lib", "-lpaho-mqtt3c"],
};
```

The `flags` option specifies to include debug information in the compiled code (`-g`); a directory to search for include files (`-I/usr/local/include`); a directory to search for library files (`-L/usr/local/lib`); a library to link with (`-lpaho-mqtt3c`, which will link with file `libpaho-mqtt3c.so`).

**Note**: Using the `flags` standard parameter when `cmake` is enabled is strongly discouraged, although supported. Flags are compiler-specific, and thus interfere with CMake's ability to find the most suitable compiler for each platform. In a similar fashion, we recommend against the use of the `compiler` standard parameter for the same reason. A better solution is to provide a `cmake-include` file, as described next.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## logging

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf rs>
This target does not support the `logging` parameter.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c py>
By default, when executing a generated Lingua Franca program, error messages, warnings, and informational messages are printed to standard out. You can get additional information printed by setting the `logging` parameter to `LOG` or `DEBUG` (or `log` or `debug`). The latter is more verbose. If you set the `logging` parameter to `warn`, then warnings and errors will be printed, but informational messages will not (e.g. message produced using the `info_print` utility function). If you set `logging` to `error`, then warning messages will also not be printed.

The C and Python targets also support [tracing](../reference/tracing.mdx), which outputs binary traces of an execution rather than human-readable text and is designed to have minimal impact on performance.
<ShowOnly cpp>
The `logging` option is one of `error`, `warn`, `info`, `log` or `debug`. It specifies the level of diagnostic messages about execution to print to the console. A message will print if this parameter is greater than or equal to the level of the message, where `error` < `warn` < `info` < `log` < `debug`. The default value is `info`, which means that messages log or debug messages will not print.
</ShowOnly>
<ShowOnly ts>
The `logging` option is one of `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `LOG` or `DEBUG`. It specifies the level of diagnostic messages about execution to print to the console. A message will print if this parameter is greater than or equal to the level of the message, where `ERROR` < `WARN` < `INFO` < `LOG` < `DEBUG`. The default value is `INFO`, which means that messages tagged `LOG` and `DEBUG` will not print. Internally this is handled by the [pinojs module](https://github.com/pinojs/pino).
</ShowOnly>
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>


## no-compile

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf ts rs >
This target does not support the `no-compile` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c cpp py>
If true, then do not invoke a target language compiler nor cmake. Just generate code.
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>


## no-runtime-validation

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c py ts rs >
This target does not support the `no-runtime-validation` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This parameter takes value `true` or `false` (the default). If this is set to true, then all runtime checks in [reactor-cpp](https://github.com/tud-ccc/reactor-cpp) will be disabled. This brings a slight performance boost but should be used with care and only on tested programs.

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## protobufs

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf cpp ts rs >
This target does not support the `protobufs` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c py>
Protobufs is a serialization protocol by which data in a target language
can be copied over the network to a remote location. The `protobufs` target
parameter gives an array of .proto files that are to be compiled and 
included in the generated code. For an example, see 
<ShowOnly c inline>[PersonProtocolBuffers.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/C/src/serialization/PersonProtocolBuffers.lf)</ShowOnly>
<ShowOnly py inline>[PersonProtocolBuffers.lf](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/blob/master/test/Python/src/serialization/PersonProtocolBuffers.lf)</ShowOnly>

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## runtime-version

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c rs py ts >
This target does not support the `runtime-version` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This argument takes a string (with quotation marks) containing any tag, branch name, or git hash in the [reactor-cpp](https://github.com/tud-ccc/reactor-cpp) repository. This will specify the _version_ of the runtime library that the compiled binary will link against.

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## rust-include

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c cpp py ts >
This target does not support the `rust-include` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This specifies a set of Rust modules in the generated project. See [Linking support files](#linking-support-files).
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## scheduler

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c cpp py ts >
This target does not support the `scheduler` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This specifies the scheduler to use. See[Target Language Details](<../reference/target-language-details.mdx#scheduler-target-property>).
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## single-file-project

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c cpp py ts >
This target does not support the `single-file-project` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
If true, enables [single-file project layout](#single-file-layout).
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## threading

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf cpp ts >
This target does not support the `threading` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
If threading is disabled (by setting `threading` to `false`), then no thread library is used, and the `lf_schedule()` function is not thread safe. This setting is incompatible with asynchronously scheduling any physical actions and hence this parameter will be ignored for programs that have physical actions.
See [workers](#workers).
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf py>
The Python target uses the single threaded C runtime by default but will switch to the multithreaded C runtime if a physical action is detected. This target property can be used to override this behavior.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
Boolean flag (either `true` (default) or `false`) that controls if the project is to be compiled with support for multi-threading.

See [workers](#workers).
</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## timeout

A time value (with units) specifying the logical stop time of execution. See [Termination](../writing-reactors/termination.mdx).

## workers

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf ts >
This target does not support the `workers` target option.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
This parameter takes a non-negative integer and specifies the number of worker threads to execute the generated program. If threading is turned on (the default, see [threading](#threading)), then the generated code will use a target platform thread library and generate multi-threaded code. This can transparently execute reactions that have no dependence on one another in parallel on multiple cores. By default, threading is turned on, and the `workers` property is set to `0`, which means that the number of workers is determined by the runtime system. Typically, it will be set to the number of cores on the machine running the code. To use a different number of worker threads, give a positive integer for this target parameter.

With value `0`, the runtime engine is free to choose the number of worker threads to use. Typically, this will equal the number of hardware threads on the machine on which the Lingua Franca code generator is run.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
This parameter takes a non-negative integer and specifies the number of worker threads to execute the generated program. With value `0` (the default), the runtime engine is free to choose the number of worker threads to use. In the $target-language$ target, the runtime system will determine the number of hardware threads on the machine on which the program is run and set the number of worker threads equal to that number.

If the `workers` property is set to `1`, the scheduler will not create any worker threads and instead inline the execution of reactions. This is an optimization and avoids any unnecessary synchronization. Note that, in contrast to the C target, the single threaded implementation is still thread safe and asynchronous reaction scheduling is supported.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf py>
This parameter takes a non-negative integer and specifies the number of worker threads to execute the generated program. Note, however, that the Python core is unable to execute safely in parallel on multiple cores. As a consequence, at execution time, each reaction invocation will acquire a mutual exclusion lock before executing. Hence, there is little point in setting this to any number greater than `1`.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
This parameter takes a non-negative integer and specifies the number of worker threads to execute the generated program. With value `0` (the default), the runtime engine is free to choose the number of worker threads to use and the number of worker threads may vary over time.

# Command-Line Arguments

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf ts >
In the TypeScript target, the generated JavaScript program understands the following command-line arguments, each of which has a short form (one character) and a long form:

- `-f, --fast [true | false]`: Specifies whether to wait for physical time to match logical time. The default is `false`. If this is `true`, then the program will execute as fast as possible, letting logical time advance faster than physical time.
- `-o, --timeout '<duration> <units>'`: Stop execution when logical time has advanced by the specified _duration_. The units can be any of nsec, usec, msec, sec, minute, hour, day, week, or the plurals of those. For the duration and units of a timeout argument to be parsed correctly as a single value, these should be specified in quotes with no leading or trailing space (e.g. '5 sec').
- `-k, --keepalive [true | false]`: Specifies whether to stop execution if there are no events to process. This defaults to `false`, meaning that the program will stop executing when there are no more events on the event queue. If you set this to `true`, then the program will keep executing until either the `timeout` logical time is reached or the program is externally killed. If you have `physical action`s, it usually makes sense to set this to `true`.
- `-l, --logging [ERROR | WARN | INFO | LOG | DEBUG]`: The level of logging messages from the reactor-ts runtime to to print to the console. Messages tagged with a given type (error, warn, etc.) will print if this argument is greater than or equal to the level of the message (`ERROR` < `WARN` < `INFO` < `LOG` < `DEBUG`).
- `-h, --help`: Print this usage guide. The program will not execute if this flag is present.

If provided, a command line argument will override whatever value the corresponding target property had specified in the source .lf file.

Command line options are parsed by the [command-line-arguments](https://github.com/75lb/command-line-args) module with [these rules](https://github.com/75lb/command-line-args/wiki/Notation-rules). For example

```sh
node <LF_file_name>/dist/<LF_file_name>.js -f false --keepalive=true -o '4 sec' -l INFO
```

is a valid setting.

Any errors in command-line arguments result in printing the above information. The program will not execute if there is a parsing error for command-line arguments.

### Custom Command-Line Arguments

User-defined command-line arguments may be created by giving the main reactor [parameters](#using-parameters). Assigning the main reactor a parameter of type `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `time` will add an argument with corresponding name and type to the generated program's command-line-interface. Custom arguments will also appear in the generated program's usage guide (from the `--help` option). If the generated program is executed with a value specified for a custom command-line argument, that value will override the default value for the corresponding parameter. Arguments typed `string`, `number`, and `boolean` are parsed in the expected way, but `time` arguments must be specified on the command line like the `--timeout` property as `'<duration> <units>'` (in quotes).

Note: Custom arguments may not have the same names as standard arguments like `timeout` or `keepalive`.

For example this reactor has a custom command line argument named `customArg` of type `number` and default value `2`:

```lf-ts
target TypeScript;
main reactor clArg(customArg:number(2)) {
    reaction (startup) {=
        console.log(customArg);
    =}
}
```

If this reactor is compiled from the file `simpleCLArgs.lf`, executing

```sh
node simpleCLArgs/dist/simpleCLArgs.js
```

outputs the default value `2`. But running

```sh
node simpleCLArgs/dist/simpleCLArgs.js --customArg=42
```

outputs `42`. Additionally, we can view documentation for the custom command line argument with the `--help` command.

```sh
node simpleCLArgs/dist/simpleCLArgs.js -h
```

The program will generate the standard usage guide, but also

```
--customArg '<duration> <units>'                    Custom argument. Refer to
                                                      <path>/simpleCLArgs.lf
                                                      for documentation.
```

### Additional types for Custom Command-Line Arguments

Main reactor parameters that are not typed `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `time` will not create custom command-line arguments. However, that doesn't mean it is impossible to obtain other types from the command line, just use a `string` and specify how the parsing is done yourself. See below for an example of a reactor that parses a custom command-line argument of type `string` into a state variable of type `Array<number>` using `JSON.parse` and a [user-defined type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards).

```lf-ts
target TypeScript;
main reactor customType(arrayArg:string("")) {
    preamble {=
        function isArrayOfNumbers(x: any): x is Array<number> {
            for (let item of x) {
                if (typeof item !== "number") {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    =}
    state foo:{=Array<number>=}({=[]=});
    reaction (startup) {=
        let parsedArgument = JSON.parse(customType);
        if (isArrayOfNumbers(parsedArgument)) {
            foo = parsedArgument;
            }
        else {
            throw new Error("Custom command line argument is not an array of numbers.");
        }
        console.log(foo);
    =}
}
```
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf c>
The generated C program understands the following command-line arguments, each of which has a short form (one character) and a long form:

- `-f, --fast [true | false]`: Specifies whether to wait for physical time to match logical time. The default is `false`. If this is `true`, then the program will execute as fast as possible, letting logical time advance faster than physical time.
- `-o, --timeout <duration> <units>`: Stop execution when logical time has advanced by the specified _duration_. The units can be any of nsec, usec, msec, sec, minute, hour, day, week, or the plurals of those.
- `-w, --workers <n>`: Executed using \<n\> worker threads if possible. This option is ignored in the single-threaded version. That is, it is ignored if a `threading` option was given in the target properties with value `false`.
- `-i, --id <n>`: The ID of the federation that this reactor will join.

Any other command-line arguments result in printing the above information.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf cpp>
The generated C++ program understands the following command-line arguments, each of which has a short form (one character) and a long form:

- `-f, --fast`: If set, then the program will execute as fast as possible, letting logical time advance faster than physical time.
- `-o, --timeout '<duration> <units>'`: Stop execution when logical time has advanced by the specified _duration_. The units can be any of nsec, usec, msec, sec, minute, hour, day, week, or the plurals of those.
- `-w, --workers <n>`: Use n worker threads for executing reactions.
- `--help`: Print the above information.

If the main reactor declares parameters, these parameters will appear as additional CLI options that can be specified when invoking the binary (see [Using Parameters](#using-parameters)).
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf py>
The Python target does not currently support any command-line arguments. You must specify properties as target parameters.
</ShowIf>
<ShowIf rs>
The generated executable may feature a command-line interface (CLI), if it uses the `cargo-features: ["cli"]` target property. When that feature is enabled:

- some target properties become settable at runtime:
  - `--timeout <time value>`: override the default timeout mentioned as a target property. The syntax for times is just like the LF one (e.g. `1msec`, `"2 seconds"`).
  - `--workers <number>`: override the default worker count mentioned as a target property. This option is **ignored** unless the runtime crate has been built with the feature `parallel-runtime`.
  - `--export-graph`: export the dependency graph (corresponds to `export-dependency-graph` target property). This is a flag, i.e., absent means false, present means true. This means the value of the target property is ignored and not used as default.
  - `--log-level`: corresponds to the `logging` target property, but note that the levels have different meanings, and the target property is ignored. See [Logging levels](#logging-levels).
- parameters of the main reactor are translated to CLI parameters.
  - Each LF parameter named `param` corresponds to a CLI parameter named `--main-param`. Underscores in the LF parameter name are replaced by hyphens.
  - The type of each parameters must implement the trait [`FromStr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html).

When the `cli` feature is disabled, the parameters of the main reactor will each assume their default value.

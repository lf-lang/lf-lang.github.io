# Overview
Lingua Franca's C-runtime supports [Patmos](https://github.com/t-crest/patmos),
a bare-metal execution platform that is optimized for time-predictable execution.
The time-predictability aspect of Patmos makes it easier to obtain a worst-case
execution time (WCET) for reactions.
## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS development system. (use WSL on Windows)
- DE2-115 Development Kit, which is equipped with Altera Cyclone IV FPGA (optional)
### Getting Started
To know how to install the toolchain for building Patmos, read the Patmos project's readme at https://github.com/t-crest/patmos or study the sixth chapter of its handbook available here: [Patmos Reference Handbook](http://patmos.compute.dtu.dk/patmos_handbook.pdf). Remember that due to limitations when compiling LF programs for Patmos, you should pass `toolchain1` as an argument to the build command, as in `./misc/build.sh -q toolchain1`.
### Compiling and Running Lingua Franca codes
Patmos can run in an FPGA, but there are also two simulators available:

1. `pasim`: a software ISA simulator that is written in C++.
2. `patemu`: a cycle-accurate hardware emulator generated from the hardware description.

Consider the following simple LF program inside the HelloPatmos.lf file located in `test/C/src/patmos/HelloPatmos.lf`: 
```lf-c
target C {
	platform: "Patmos",
	single-threaded: true,
	build-type: Debug, 
}

main reactor {
	reaction(startup) {=
		printf("Hello World!\n");
	=}
}
  

```
You can generate C code using `lfc HelloPatmos.lf` command in the above folder:

```
cd test/C/src/patmos/
lfc HelloPatmos.lf
```

If there is no error after making, an executable file must be generator inside `src-gen/patmos/HelloPatmos` folder. Then, the reactor can be executed on the SW simulator with the following command:

```
cd ../../src-gen/patmos/HelloPatmos/build
pasim HelloPatmos
```
After executing the above command, the following lines must be printed.
```
Hello World!
---- Elapsed logical time (in nsec): 0
---- Elapsed physical time (in nsec): 770,000
```

The reactor can also be executed on the hardware emulator of Patmos:

```
patemu HelloPatmos
```

This execution is considerably slower than the SW simulator, as the concrete hardware
of Patmos is simulated cycle-accurate. Here is a sample of its output:

```
Hello World!
---- Elapsed logical time (in nsec): 0
---- Elapsed physical time (in nsec): 3,459,000
```

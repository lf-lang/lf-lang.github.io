## Cycles

The interconnection pattern for a collection of reactors can form a cycle, but some care is required. Consider the following example:

import C_Cycle from '../assets/code/c/src/Cycle.lf';
import Cpp_Cycle from '../assets/code/cpp/src/Cycle.lf';
import Py_Cycle from '../assets/code/py/src/Cycle.lf';
import Rs_Cycle from '../assets/code/rs/src/Cycle.lf';
import TS_Cycle from '../assets/code/ts/src/Cycle.lf';

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock c={C_Cycle} cpp={Cpp_Cycle} py={Py_Cycle} rs={Rs_Cycle} ts={TS_Cycle} lf />

This program yields the following diagram:

import CycleSVG from "./../assets/images/diagrams/Cycle.svg"

<CycleSVG title="Lingua Franca diagram: Cycle" role="img" width="400" />

The diagram highlights a **causality loop** in the program. At each tag, in reactor `B`, the first reaction has to execute before the second if it is enabled, a precedence indicated with the red dashed arrow. But the first can't execute until the reaction of `A` has executed, and that reaction cannot execute until the second reaction `B` has executed. There is no way to satisfy these requirements, so the tools refuse to generated code.

## Cycles with Delays

One way to break the causality loop and get an executable program is to introduce a [logical delay](<../writing-reactors/composing-reactors.mdx#connections-with-logical-delays>) into the loop, as shown below:

import C_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/c/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';
import Cpp_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/cpp/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';
import Py_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/py/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';
import Rs_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/rs/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';
import TS_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/ts/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock c={C_CycleWithDelay} cpp={Cpp_CycleWithDelay} py={Py_CycleWithDelay} rs={Rs_CycleWithDelay} ts={TS_CycleWithDelay} lf />

import CycleWithDelaySVG from "./../assets/images/diagrams/CycleWithDelay.svg"

<CycleWithDelaySVG title="Lingua Franca diagram: CycleWithDelay" role="img" width="400" />

Here, we have used a delay of 0, which results in a delay of one [microstep](../writing-reactors/superdense-time.mdx). We could equally well have specified a positive time value.

## Reaction Order

Frequently, a program will have such cycles, but you don't want a logical delay in the loop. To get a cycle without logical delays, the reactions need to be reordered, as shown below:

import C_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/c/src/CycleReordered.lf';
import Cpp_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/cpp/src/CycleReordered.lf';
import Py_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/py/src/CycleReordered.lf';
import Rs_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/rs/src/CycleReordered.lf';
import TS_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/ts/src/CycleReordered.lf';

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock c={C_CycleReordered} cpp={Cpp_CycleReordered} py={Py_CycleReordered} rs={Rs_CycleReordered} ts={TS_CycleReordered} lf />

import CycleReorderedSVG from "./../assets/images/diagrams/CycleReordered.svg"

<CycleReorderedSVG title="Lingua Franca diagram: CycleReordered" role="img" width="400" />

There is no longer any causality loop.

	abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as essential tools for virtualizing and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by providing synchronized digital counterparts that enable monitoring, control, prediction, and optimization. Initially conceived as passive digital shadows, DTs are increasingly evolving into intelligent and proactive entities, enabled by the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among these advancements, Opportunistic Digital Twins (ODTs) represent a novel class of DTs: living, AI-aided, and actionable models that opportunistically exploit edge-cloud resources to deliver enriched and adaptive representations of physical entities and processes. However, despite their promise, current research lacks systematic engineering methods to ensure reliable coordination, determinism, and real-time responsiveness of ODTs in distributed and resource-constrained CPS. This article addresses this gap by introducing an engineering approach to build dependable and efficient ODTs by leveraging the deterministic concurrency, explicit timing semantics, and disciplined event handling of Lingua Franca (LF). The approach is exemplified through a Smart Traffic Management case study centered on Emergency Vehicle Preemption (EVP), where the ODT dynamically selects AI models based on runtime conditions while ensuring deterministic coordination across distributed nodes. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our methodology, underscoring the potential of LF-based ODT engineering to enhance reliability, adaptability, and scalability in intelligent and distributed CPS deployments.}

   abstract = {Ensuring predictable and deterministic behavior in distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS) is essential for guaranteeing safety, reliability, and real-time behavior. However, achieving this predictability is challenging due to network uncertainties, asynchronous execution, and complex timing interactions. This manuscript is based on a special session at Embedded Systems Week (ESWeek) 2025, which brings together experts to explore in four presentations how this uncertainty can be addressed and how to introduce additional determinism into the system to achieve predictable timing behavior in distributed CPS. We begin by exploring cornerstones of timing analysis techniques to provide end-to-end latency guarantees for distributed systems (Chen and Günzel). Next, we discuss design strategies for meeting timing constraints, focusing on how system parameters influence cause-effect chains and how these parameters can be tuned to ensure predictable behavior in industrial automation settings (Dasari and Becker). We then turn to approaches to achieve more predictable system behavior. To that end, we examine deterministic semantic models for distributed systems that enable the design of robust and fault-tolerant systems (Lee). Finally, we discuss how solving constraints for scheduling cause-effect chains can be used to enforce strict timing guarantees and improve predictability (Bourke).}

This paper explores a number of mitigations, focusing primarily on the use of logical time to define a semantic ordering for messages. A variety of coordination mechanisms can ensure that messages are handled in logical time order, but they all come with costs. A fundamental tradeoff (the CAL theorem) makes it impossible to achieve consistency without paying a price in availability, where the price depends on the latencies introduced by network communication, computation overhead, and clock synchronization error. This paper shows how to use the Lingua Franca coordination language to navigate this tradeoff, and particularly how to ensure eventual consistency while bounding unavailability with manageable risk.},

We also show the maximum latency that can be tolerated without causing inconsistency. We then use the coordination language Lingua Franca to implement the model. It can also simulate network switches, allowing you to set up test scenarios that include network degradation, such as switch failures, packet losses, and excessive latency. This can be set up as a hardware-in-the-loop simulation, where the actual node implementations interact with simulated switches and the network.},

   abstract = {Discrete-event (DE) systems are concurrent programs where components communicate via tagged events, where tags are drawn from a totally ordered set. Distributed DE (DDE) systems are DE systems where the components (reactors) communicate over networks. Most execution platforms require that for DDE systems with cycles, each cycle must contain at least one logical delay, where the tag of events is incremented. Some impose an even stronger constraint, that no component produce outputs with the same timestamp as a triggering input (the “lookahead” for the component must be greater than zero). Such restrictions, however, are not required by the elegant fixed-point semantics of DE. The only fundamental requirement is that the program be constructive, meaning it is free from causality cycles. In this paper, we propose a way to coordinate the execution of DDE systems that can execute any constructive program, even one with zero-delay cycles (ZDC), facilitating the elegant programming of strongly consistent distributed real-time systems. The proposed coordination provides a formal model that exposes exactly the information that must be shared across networks for such execution to be possible. Our solution avoids speculative execution and rollback, making it suitable for situations that do not tolerate rollback, such as deployment (vs. simulation) of cyber-physical systems (CPS’s). We describe an extension to the coordination mechanisms in Lingua Franca, a recent DE-based coordination language, to support ZDC.},

   abstract = {To design performant, expressive, and reliable cyber-physical systems (CPSs), researchers extensively perform quasi-static scheduling for concurrent models of computation (MoCs) on multi-core hardware. However, these quasi-static scheduling approaches are developed independently for their corresponding MoCs, despite commonality in the approaches. To help generalize the use of quasi-static scheduling to new and emerging MoCs, this paper proposes a unified approach for a class of deterministic timed concurrent models (DTCMs), including prominent models such as synchronous dataflow (SDF), Boolean-controlled dataflow (BDF), scenario-aware dataflow (SADF), and Logical Execution Time (LET). In contrast to scheduling techniques tailored exclusively to specific MoCs, our unified approach leverages a common intermediate formalism called state space finite automata (SSFA), bridging the gap between high-level MoCs and executable schedules. Once identified as DTCMs, new MoCs can directly adopt SSFA-based scheduling, significantly easing adoption. We show that quasi-static schedules facilitated by SSFA are provably free from timing anomalies and enable straightforward worst-case makespan analysis. We demonstrate the approach using the reactor model—an emerging discrete-event MoC—programmed using the Lingua Franca (LF) language. Experiments show that quasi-statically scheduled LF programs exhibit lower runtime overhead compared to the dynamically scheduled LF programs, and that the analyzable worst-case makespans enable compile-time deadline checking.},

Discrete-event (DE) systems serve as an effective model of computation for distributed CPS requiring precise timing control. The high-level architecture (HLA) has been widely used for the simulation of distributed DE (DDE) systems and can be extended for the implementation of distributed CPS. We find that HLA imposes excessive network communication overhead, specifically, through the run-time infrastructure (RTI), for the coordination of timed events for some applications. This paper identifies inefficiencies and proposes a novel approach that reduces the number of messages without compromising control over timing.

	abstract     = {Formal verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging because it has to consider real-time and concurrency aspects that are often absent in ordinary software. Moreover, the software in CPS is often complex and low-level, making it hard to assure that a formal model of the system used for verification is a faithful representation of the actual implementation, which can undermine the value of a verification result. To address this problem, we propose a methodology for building verifiable CPS based on the principle that a formal model of the software can be derived automatically from its implementation. Our approach requires that the system implementation is specified in Lingua Franca (LF), a polyglot coordination language tailored for real-time, concurrent CPS, which we made amenable to the specification of safety properties via annotations in the code. The program structure and the deterministic semantics of LF enable automatic construction of formal axiomatic models directly from LF programs. The generated models are automatically checked using Bounded Model Checking (BMC) by the verification engine Uclid5 using the Z3 SMT solver. The proposed technique enables checking a well-defined fragment of Safety Metric Temporal Logic (Safety MTL) formulas. To ensure the completeness of BMC, we present a method to derive an upper bound on the completeness threshold of an axiomatic model based on the semantics of LF. We implement our approach in the LF Verifier and evaluate it using a benchmark suite with 22 programs sampled from real-life applications and benchmarks for Erlang, Lustre, actor-oriented languages, and RTOSes. The LF Verifier correctly checks 21 out of 22 programs automatically.},

Consistency is agreement on the values of shared variables; availability is the ability to respond to reads and writes accessing those shared variables. Availability is a real-time property whereas consistency is a logical property. We extend consistency and availability to refer to cyber-physical properties such as the state of the physical system and delays in actuation. We have further extended the CAP theorem to relate quantitative measures of these two properties to quantitative measures of communication and computation latency (L), obtaining a relation called the CAL theorem that is linear in a max-plus algebra. This paper shows how to use the CAL theorem in various ways to help design cyber-physical systems. We develop a methodology for systematically trading off availability and consistency in application-specific ways and to guide the system designer when putting functionality in end devices, in edge computers, or in the cloud. We build on the Lingua Franca coordination language to provide system designers with concrete analysis and design tools to make the required tradeoffs in deployable embedded software.},

They promise to be efficient and scale well to a large number of cores or nodes in a distributed system. However, they also expose programmers to nondeterminism, which often makes implementations hard to understand, debug, and test. The recently proposed reactor model is a promising alternative that enables deterministic concurrency. In this article, we present an efficient, parallel implementation of reactors and demonstrate that the determinacy of reactors does not imply a loss in performance. To show this, we evaluate Lingua Franca (LF), a reactor-oriented coordination language. LF equips mainstream programming languages with a deterministic concurrency model that automatically takes advantage of opportunities to exploit parallelism. Our implementation of the Savina benchmark suite demonstrates that, in terms of execution time, the runtime performance of LF programs even exceeds popular and highly optimized actor frameworks. We compare against Akka and CAF, which LF outperforms by 1.86\texttimes{} and 1.42\texttimes{}, respectively.},

A major source of difficulty is the highly variable network latencies that applications must deal with. It is well known in distributed computing that when network latencies rise sufficiently, one or both of consistency and availability must be sacrificed. This paper quantifies consistency and availability and gives an algebraic relationship between these quantities and network latencies. The algebraic relation is linear in a max-plus algebra and supports heterogeneous networks, where the communication latency between 2 components may differ from the latency between another 2 components. We show how to make use of this algebraic relation to guide design, enabling software designers to specify consistency and availability requirements, and to derive from those the requirements on network latencies. We show how to design systems to fail in predictable ways when the network latency requirements are violated, by choosing to sacrifice either consistency or availability.}

This paper outlines four concurrent design patterns: alignment, precedence, simultaneity, and consistency, all of which are relevant to general-purpose software applications. We show that a semantics of logical time provides a natural framework for reasoning about concurrency, makes some difficult problems easy, and offers a quantified interpretation of the CAP theorem, enabling quantified evaluation of the tradeoff between consistency and availability.}

	abstract     = {Many programming languages and programming frameworks focus on parallel and distributed computing. Several frameworks are based on actors, which provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads. The interactions between actors, however, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. We show that nondeterminism can be handled in a number of ways, surveying dataflow dialects, process networks, synchronous-reactive models, and discrete-event models. These existing approaches, however, tend to require centralized control, pose challenges to modular system design, or introduce a single point of failure. We describe “reactors,” a new coordination model that combines ideas from several of these approaches to enable determinism while preserving much of the style of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. By using a logical model of time that can be associated with physical time, reactors also provide control over timing. Reactors also expose parallelism that can be exploited on multicore machines and in distributed configurations without compromising determinacy.},

	abstract     = {Actors have become widespread in programming languages and programming frameworks focused on parallel and distributed computing. While actors provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads, their interactions, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. The same problem exists in other dominant concurrency models, such as threads, shared-memory models, publish-subscribe systems, and service-oriented architectures. We propose “reactors,” a new model of concurrent computation that combines synchronous-reactive principles with a sophisticated model of time to enable determinism while preserving much of the style and performance of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. The relationship that reactors establish between events across timelines allows for: 1. the construction of programs that react predictably to unpredictable external events; 2. the formulation of deadlines that grant control over timing; and 3. the preservation of a deterministic distributed execution semantics under quantifiable assumptions. We bring the deterministic concurrency and time-based semantics of reactors to the world of mainstream programming languages through Lingua Franca (LF), a polyglot coordination language with support (so far) for C, C++, Python, and TypeScript. In LF, program logic is given in one or more of those target languages, enabling developers to use familiar languages and integrate extensive libraries and legacy code. The main contributions of this work consist of a formalization of reactors, the implementation of an efficient runtime system for the execution of reactors, and the design and implementation of LF.}

The model leverages a semantic notion of time, an event scheduler, and a synchronous-reactive style of communication to achieve determinism. Reactors enable a programming model that ensures determinism, unless explicitly abandoned by the programmer. We show how the coordination of reactors can safely and transparently exploit parallelism, both in shared-memory and distributed systems.}

## Reaction Order

A reactor may have multiple reactions, and more than one reaction may be enabled at any given tag. In Lingua Franca semantics, if two or more reactions of the same reactor are **simultaneously enabled**, then they will be invoked sequentially in the order in which they are declared. More strongly, the reactions of a reactor are **mutually exclusive** and are invoked in tag order primarily and declaration order secondarily. Consider the following example:

$start(Alignment)$

```lf-c
target C {
  timeout: 3 secs
}
main reactor Alignment {
  state s: int = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  timer t4(400 msec, 400 msec)
  reaction(t1) {=
    self->s += 1;
  =}
  reaction(t2) {=
    self->s -= 2;
  =}
  reaction(t4) {=
    printf("s = %d\n", self->s);
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp {
  timeout: 3 s
}
main reactor Alignment {
  state s: int(0)
  timer t1(100 ms, 100 ms)
  timer t2(200 ms, 200 ms)
  timer t4(400 ms, 400 ms)
  reaction(t1) {=
    s += 1;
  =}
  reaction(t2) {=
    s -= 2;
  =}
  reaction(t4) {=
    std::cout << "s = " << std::to_string(s) << std::endl;
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python {
  timeout: 3 secs
}
main reactor Alignment {
  state s = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  timer t4(400 msec, 400 msec)
  reaction(t1) {=
    self.s += 1
  =}
  reaction(t2) {=
    self.s -= 2
  =}
  reaction(t4) {=
    print(f"s = {self.s}")
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
target TypeScript {
  timeout: 3 s
}
main reactor Alignment {
  state s: number = 0
  timer t1(100 ms, 100 ms)
  timer t2(200 ms, 200 ms)
  timer t4(400 ms, 400 ms)
  reaction(t1) {=
    s += 1
  =}
  reaction(t2) {=
    s -= 2
  =}
  reaction(t4) {=
    console.log(`s = ${s}`)
  =}
}
```

```lf-rs
target Rust {
  timeout: 3 secs
}
main reactor Alignment {
  state s: u32 = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  timer t4(400 msec, 400 msec)
  reaction(t1) {=
    self.s += 1;
  =}
  reaction(t2) {=
    self.s -= 2;
  =}
  reaction(t4) {=
    println!("s = {}", self.s);
  =}
}
```

$end(Alignment)$

Every 100 ms, this increments the state variable `s` by 1, every 200 ms, it decrements `s` by 2, and every 400 ms, it prints the value of `s`. When these reactions align, they are invoked in declaration order, and, as a result, the printed value of `s` is always 0.

## Overwriting Outputs

Just as the reactions of the `Alignment` reactor overwrite the state variable `s`, logically simultaneous reactions can overwrite outputs. Consider the following example:

$start(Overwriting)$

```lf-c
target C
reactor Overwriting {
  output y: int
  state s: int = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  reaction(t1) -> y {=
    self->s += 1;
    lf_set(y, self->s);
  =}
  reaction(t2) -> y {=
    self->s -= 2;
    lf_set(y, self->s);
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp
reactor Overwriting {
  output y: int
  state s: int(0)
  timer t1(100 ms, 100 ms)
  timer t2(200 ms, 200 ms)
  reaction(t1) -> y {=
    s += 1;
    y.set(s);
  =}
  reaction(t2) -> y {=
    s -= 2;
    y.set(s);
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python
reactor Overwriting {
  output y
  state s = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  reaction(t1) -> y {=
    self.s += 1
    y.set(self.s)
  =}
  reaction(t2) -> y {=
    self.s -= 2
    y.set(self.s)
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
target TypeScript
reactor Overwriting {
  output y: number
  state s: number = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  reaction(t1) -> y {=
    s += 1
    y = s
  =}
  reaction(t2) -> y {=
    s -= 2
    y = s
  =}
}
```

```lf-rs
target Rust
reactor Overwriting {
  output y: u32
  state s: u32 = 0
  timer t1(100 msec, 100 msec)
  timer t2(200 msec, 200 msec)
  reaction(t1) -> y {=
    self.s += 1;
    ctx.set(y, self.s);
  =}
  reaction(t2) -> y {=
    self.s -= 2;
    ctx.set(y, self.s);
  =}
}
```

$end(Overwriting)$

Here, the reaction to `t1` will set the output to 1 or 2, but every time it sets it to 2, the second reaction (to `t2`) will overwrite the output with the value 0. As a consequence, the outputs will be 1, 0, 1, 0, ... deterministically.

## Reacting to Outputs of Contained Reactors

A reaction may be triggered by the an input to the reactor, but also by an output of a contained reactor, as illustrated in the following example:

$start(Contained)$

```lf-c
target C
import Overwriting from "Overwriting.lf"
main reactor {
  s = new Overwriting()
  reaction(s.y) {=
    if (s.y->value != 0 && s.y->value != 1) {
      lf_print_error_and_exit("Outputs should only be 0 or 1!");
    }
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp
import Overwriting from "Overwriting.lf"
main reactor {
  s = new Overwriting()
  reaction(s.y) {=
    auto is_correct = [](auto value){
      return value == 0 || value == 1;
    };
    if (s.y.is_present() && !is_correct(*s.y.get())) {
      std::cout << "Output shoudl only be 0 or 1!" << std::endl;
    }
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python
import Overwriting from "Overwriting.lf"
main reactor {
  s = new Overwriting()
  reaction(s.y) {=
    if s.y.value != 0 and s.y.value != 1:
      sys.stderr.write("ERROR: Outputs should only be 0 or 1!\n")
      exit(1)
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
target TypeScript
import Overwriting from "Overwriting.lf"
main reactor {
  s = new Overwriting()
  reaction(s.y) {=
    if (s.y != 0 && s.y != 1) {
      util.requestErrorStop("Outputs should only be 0 or 1!")
    }
  =}
}
```

```lf-rs
target Rust
import Overwriting from "Overwriting.lf"
main reactor {
  s = new Overwriting()
  reaction(s.y) {=
    let value = ctx.get(s__y).unwrap();
    if value != 0 && value != 1 {
      eprintln!("Output schould only be 0 or 1!");
      ctx.request_stop(Asap);
    }
  =}
}
```

$end(Contained)$

This instantiates the above `Overwriting` reactor and monitors its outputs.

## Triggering Contained Reactors

A reaction can set the input of a contained reactor, thereby triggering its reactions, as illustrated in the following example:

$start(Triggering)$

```lf-c
target C
reactor Inside {
  input x: int
  reaction(x) {=
    printf("Received %d\n", x->value);=
  =}
}
main reactor {
  i = new Inside()
  reaction(startup) -> i.x {=
    lf_set(i.x, 42);
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp
reactor Inside {
  input x: int
  reaction(x) {=
    std::cout << "Received " << std::to_string(*x.get()) << std::endl;
  =}
}
main reactor {
  i = new Inside()
  reaction(startup) -> i.x {=
    i.x.set(42);
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python
reactor Inside {
  input x
  reaction(x) {=
    print(f"Received {x.value}")
  =}
}
main reactor {
  i = new Inside()
  reaction(startup) -> i.x {=
    i.x.set(42);
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
target TypeScript
reactor Inside {
  input x: number
  reaction(x) {=
    console.log("Received ${x}");
  =}
}
main reactor {
  i = new Inside()
  reaction(startup) -> i.x {=
    i.x = 42
  =}
}
```

```lf-rs
target Rust
reactor Inside {
  input x: u32
  reaction(x) {=
    println!("Received {}", ctx.get(x).unwrap());
  =}
}
main reactor {
  i = new Inside()
  reaction(startup) -> i.x {=
    ctx.set(i__x, 42);
  =}
}
```

$end(Triggering)$

The reaction to $startup$ declares the input port of the inside reactor as an effect and then sets it with value 42.
This will cause the inside reactor's reaction to execute and print `Received 42`.

## Startup, Shutdown, and Reset Reactions

Reactions may be triggered by the special events $startup$, $shutdown$, or $reset$.
For example,

```lf
  reaction(startup) {=
    // ... Do something
  =}
```

A reaction to $startup$ is triggered at the very first tag when the program begins (or, if within a mode of a [modal reactor](/docs/handbook/modal-models), when the mode is first entered).
This reaction will be logically simultaneous with reactions to [timers](/docs/handbook/time-and-timers) that have a zero offset.
As usual, for logically simultaneous reactions declared within the same reactor, the order in which they are invoked will be governed by the order in which they are declared.

A reaction to $shutdown$ is invoked at program termination.
See the [Termination](/docs/handbook/termination) section for details.

<div class="lf-cpp lf-ts lf-rs">

Reactions to the $reset$ event are not supported in $target-language$ because [modal reactors](/docs/handbook/modal-models) are not supported.

</div>

<div class="lf-c lf-py">

A reaction to the $reset$ event is invoked if the reaction or reactor is within a mode of a [modal reactor](/docs/handbook/modal-models) and the mode is entered via a reset transition.
For details, see the [Modal Reactors](/docs/handbook/modal-models) section.

</div>

## Method Declaration

<div class="lf-ts lf-rs">

The $target-language$ target does not currently support methods.

</div>

<div class="lf-cpp lf-c lf-py">

<div class="lf-cpp lf-c">

A method declaration has one of the forms:

```lf
  method <name>() {= ... =}
  method <name>():<type> {= ... =}
  method <name>(<argument_name>:<type>, ...) {= ... =}
  method <name>(<argument_name>:<type>, ...):<type> {= ... =}
```

The first form defines a method with no arguments and no return value. The second form defines a method with the return type `<type>` but no arguments. The third form defines a method with a comma-separated list of arguments given by their name and type, but without a return value. Finally, the fourth form is similar to the third, but adds a return type.

</div>

<div class="lf-py">

A method declaration has the forms:

```lf
  method <name>() {= ... =}
```

</div>

<div class="lf-cpp">

The $method$ keyword can optionally be prefixed with the $const$ qualifier, which indicates that the method is read only.

</div>

Methods are particularly useful in reactors that need to perform certain operations on state variables and/or parameters that are shared between reactions or that are too complex to be implemented in a single reaction. Analogous to class methods, methods in LF can access all state variables and parameters, and can be invoked from all reaction bodies or from other methods. Methods may also recursively invoke themselves. Consider the following example:

$start(Methods)$

```lf-c
target C
main reactor Methods {
  state foo: int = 2
  method getFoo(): int {=
    return self->foo;
  =}
  method add(x: int) {=
    self->foo += x;
  =}
  reaction(startup) {=
    lf_print("Foo is initialized to %d", getFoo());
    add(40);
    lf_print("2 + 40 = %d", getFoo());
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp
main reactor Methods {
  state foo: int(2)
  const method getFoo(): int {=
    return foo;
  =}
  method add(x: int) {=
    foo += x;
  =}
  reaction(startup) {=
    std::cout << "Foo is initialized to " << getFoo() << '\n';
    add(40);
    std::cout << "2 + 40 = " << getFoo() << '\n';
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python
main reactor Methods {
  state foo = 2
  method getFoo() {=
    return self.foo
  =}
  method add(x) {=
    self.foo += x
  =}
  reaction(startup) {=
    print(f"Foo is initialized to {self.getFoo()}.")
    self.add(40)
    print(f"2 + 40 = {self.getFoo()}.")
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
WARNING: No source file found: ../code/ts/src/Methods.lf
```

```lf-rs
WARNING: No source file found: ../code/rs/src/Methods.lf
```

$end(Methods)$

This reactor defines two methods `getFoo` and `add`.
<span class="lf-cpp">
`getFoo` is qualified as a const method, which indicates that it has read-only
access to the state variables. This is directly translated to a C++ const method
in the code generation process.
</span>
The `getFoo` method receives no arguments and returns an integer (`int`)
indicating the current value of the `foo` state variable. The `add` method
returns nothing
<span class="lf-cpp lf-c">
(`void`)
</span>
and receives one integer argument, which it uses to increment `foo`. Both
methods are visible in all reactions of the reactor. In this example, the
reaction to startup calls both methods in order to read and modify its state.

</div>

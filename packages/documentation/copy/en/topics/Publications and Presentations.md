## Published Papers

**NOTE:** Lingua Franca is an evolving language, and the older papers below may use a syntax that does not match the current syntax. Nevertheless, these papers are useful for understanding the principles. The definitive language reference is [on the wiki](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/wiki).

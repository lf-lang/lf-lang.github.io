$page-showing-target$
See the [requirements](/docs/handbook/target-language-details#requirements) for using this target.

## Minimal Example

A minimal but complete Lingua Franca file with one reactor is this:

$start(HelloWorld)$

```lf-c
target C
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    printf("Hello World.\n");
  =}
}
```

```lf-cpp
target Cpp
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    std::cout << "Hello World." << std::endl;
  =}
}
```

```lf-py
target Python
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    print("Hello World.")
  =}
}
```

```lf-ts
target TypeScript
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    console.log("Hello World.")
  =}
}
```

```lf-rs
target Rust
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    println!("Hello World.");
  =}
}
```

$end(HelloWorld)$

Every Lingua Franca program begins with a [target declaration](/docs/handbook/target-declaration) that specifies the language in which reactions are written. This is also the language of the program(s) generated by the Lingua Franca code generator.

Every LF program also has a $main$ [ or $federated$]{federated} reactor, which is the top level of a hierarchy of contained and interconnected reactors. The above simple example has no contained reactors.

The $main$ reactor above has a single $reaction$, which is triggered by the $startup$ trigger. This trigger causes the reaction to execute at the start of the program. The body of the reaction, delimited by `{= ... =}`, is ordinary $target-language$ code which, as we will see, has access to a number of functions and variables specific to Lingua Franca.

## Examples

Examples of Lingua Franca programs can be found in the [Lingua Franca Playground](https://github.com/lf-lang/playground-lingua-franca/tree/main).

The [regression tests](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/tree/master/test/) have a rich set of examples that illustrate every feature of the language.

## Structure of an LF Project

The Lingua Franca tools assume that LF programs are put into a file with a `.lf` extension that is stored somewhere within a directory called `src`. To compile and run the above example, choose a **project root** directory, create a `src` directory within that, and put the above code into a file called, say, `src/HelloWorld.lf`. You can compile the code on the [command line](/docs/handbook/command-line-tools), within [Visual Studio Code](/docs/handbook/code-extension), or within the [Epoch IDE](/docs/handbook/epoch-ide). On the command line this will look like this:

```
    > lfc src/HelloWorld.lf
    ... output from the code generator and compiler ...
```

<div class="lf-c lf-cpp lf-rs">

After this completes, two additional directories will have been created within
the project root, `bin` and `src-gen`. The `bin` directory has an
executable file called `HelloWorld`. Executing that file will result, not
surprisingly, in printing "Hello World". The generated source files will be
in a subdirectory called `HelloWorld` within `src-gen`.

</div>

<div class="lf-ts lf-py">

After this completes, an additional `src-gen` directory will have been created within the project root. The generated code will be in subdirectory called `HelloWorld` within `src-gen`. The output from the code generator will include instructions for executing the generated code:

```lf-ts
#####################################
To run the generated program, use:

    node ...path-to-project.../src-gen/Minimal/dist/Minimal.js

#####################################
```

```lf-py
#####################################
To run the generated program, use:

    python3 ...path-to-project.../src-gen/Minimal/Minimal.py

#####################################
```

</div>

## Reactor Block

A $reactor$ is a software component that reacts to input events, timer events, and internal events. It has private state variables that are not visible to any other reactor. Its reactions can consist of altering its own state, sending messages to other reactors, or affecting the environment through some kind of actuation or side effect (e.g., printing a message, as in the above `HelloWorld` example).

The general structure of a reactor definition is as follows:

<div class="lf-c lf-ts">

```lf
[main or federated] reactor <class-name> [(<parameters>)] {
    input <name>:<type>
    output <name>:<type>
    state <name>:<type>(<value>)
    timer <name>([<offset>, [<period>]])
    logical action <name>[:<type>]
    physical action <name>[:<type>]
    reaction(<triggers>) [<uses>] [=> <effects>] {= ... body ...=}
    <instance-name> = new <class-name>([<parameter-assignments>])
    <instance-name> [, ...] => <instance-name> [, ...] [after <delay>]
}
```

</div>

<div class="lf-cpp lf-rs">

```lf
[main] reactor <class-name> [(<parameters>)] {
    input <name>:<type>
    output <name>:<type>
    state <name>:<type>(<value>)
    timer <name>([<offset>, [<period>]])
    logical action <name>[:<type>]
    physical action <name>[:<type>]
    [const] method <name>(<parameters>):<type> {= ... body ...=}
    reaction(<triggers>) [<uses>] [=> <effects>] {= ... body ...=}
    <instance-name> = new <class-name>([<parameter-assignments>])
    <instance-name> [, ...] => <instance-name> [, ...] [after <delay>]
}
```

</div>

<div class="lf-py">

```lf
[main or federated] reactor <class-name> [(<parameters>)] {
    input <name>
    output <name>
    state <name>(<value>)
    timer <name>([<offset>, [<period>]])
    logical action <name>
    physical action <name>
    [const] method <name>(<parameters>) {= ... body ...=}
    reaction(<triggers>) [<uses>] [=> <effects>] {= ... body ...=}
    <instance-name> = new <class-name>([<parameter-assignments>])
    <instance-name> [, ...] => <instance-name> [, ...] [after <delay>]
}
```

</div>

Contents within square brackets are optional, contents within `<...>` are user-defined, and each line may appear zero or more times, as explained in the next pages. Parameters, inputs, outputs, timers, actions, and contained reactors all have names, and the names are required to be distinct from one another.

If the $reactor$ keyword is preceded by $main$[ or $federated$]{federated}, then this reactor will be instantiated and run by the generated code.

Any number of reactors may be defined in one file, and a $main$[ or $federated$]{federated} reactor need not be given a name, but if it is given a name, then that name must match the file name.

Reactors may extend other reactors, inheriting their properties, and a file may import reactors from other files. If an imported LF file contains a $main$[ or $federated$]{federated} reactor, that reactor is ignored (it will not be imported). This makes it easy to create a library of reusable reactors that each come with a test case or demonstration in the form of a main reactor.

## Comments

Lingua Franca files can have C/C++/Java-style comments and/or Python-style comments. All of the following are valid comments:

```
    // Single-line C-style comment.
    /*
     * Multi-line C-style comment.
     */
    # Single-line Python-style comment.
```

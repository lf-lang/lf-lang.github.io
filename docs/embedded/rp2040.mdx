# Overview
Lingua Franca's C-runtime supports the [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040),
an inexpensive microcontroller that is typically used without an operating system ("bare metal").
A [series of lab exercises](https://lf-lang.org/embedded-lab/) have been developed for instructional use, but these also serve as the best documentation and guide for developing programs for the RP2040.
These lab exercises use the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86),
which has an RP2040, but the exercises can be adapted to other robots and RP2040 platforms, including the Raspberry Pi Pico board. See the [Embedded Systems Labs](https://lf-lang.org/embedded-lab/) and [Template for the Lingua Franca RP2040 target platform](https://github.com/lf-lang/lf-pico-template) for more information.

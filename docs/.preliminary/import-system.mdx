_The following topics are meant as collections of design ideas, with the purpose
of refining them into concrete design proposals._

# Current Implementation of Imports

The import functionality in Lingua Franca is limited to:

    import HelloWorld.lf

This can be useful if the `.lf` file is located in the same directory as the
file containing the main reactor.

However, several shortcomings exist in this current system which we shall
discuss next.

## Duplicate Reactor Names

Reactors with the same name can cause issues. For example:

```
import CatsAndPuppies.lf // Contains a Puppy reactor
import MeanPuppies.lf   // Contains another Puppy reactor
```

There is no way for the LF program to distinguish between the two `Puppy`
reactors.

**Note.** With a relatively trivial extension to the current LF import
mechanism, it is possible to detect duplicates, but there is no way to
circumvent them in the current LF program (i.e., the original names might have
to be changed).

## Selective Importing

Selective importing is not possible. For example, using

```
import CatsAndPuppies.lf
```

will import all the reactors contained in the `.lf` file. It would be desirable
to selectively import a subset of reactors in another `.lf` file.

## Qualified Paths

Currently, there is no elegant way of importing modules that are not in the same
directory.

## Renaming

All the reactors imported will have the name originally given to them by the
original programmer. It might make sense to rename them for the current LF
program.

## Packages

With the current import solution that only uses files, implementing packages in
Lingua Franca is not feasible.

# Proposed Solution

With inspirations from Python, we propose the following import mechanism:

```
"import" LF_Trunc_File/module ("," LF_Trunc_File/module)*
              | "from" LFTruncFile/module "import" reactor ["as" name]
                ("," reactor ["as" name] )*
              | "from" LF_Trunc_File/module "import" "*"
```

Before discussing some examples, let's discuss `LF_Trunc_File/module`. First and
foremost, `LF_Truc_File` stands for Lingua Franca Truncated File, which is a
`name.lf` file with the `.lf` removed. Therefore, the legacy support for import
can be carried over as:

```
import HelloWorld
```

Second, the `module` would introduce the notion of packages to Lingua Franca.
The content of a module can be located in any path. To enable this facility,
modules provide a Lingua Franca Meta file (LFM) that introduces the package
name, and the absolute or relative paths of all the LF files that are included
in that package. For example:

```
// CatsAndPuppies.LFM
package CatsAndPuppies // Optional. The file name would be interpreted as the package name.
import /home/user/linguafranca/pets/Cats.lf // Absolute paths
import pets/Puppies.lf // Relative paths
```

For a package to be accessible, the `LFM` file needs to be discoverable. For
example, it can be automatically added to the current directory or "installed"
in a known Lingua Franca path (e.g., `/usr/local/LF/packages` or
`/home/user/linguafranca/packages`).

With that in mind, let's discuss some examples on how this might work next. The
content of the `HelloWorld.lf` example is as follows:

```
target C;
reactor SayHello {
    timer t;
    reaction(t) {=
        printf("Hello World.\n");
    =}
}
main reactor HelloWorldTest {
    a = new HelloWorld();
}
```

Let us create a `Greetings.lf` program based on HelloWorld.

```
target C;
import HelloWorld

main reactor Greetings {
    a = new SayHello();
}
```

To generate code for `Greetings.lf`, Lingua Franca first searches for a
`HelloWorld.lf` file in the same directory as `Greetings.lf`. If not found, it
will look for a `HelloWorld.LFM` in the known paths. If none is found, an error
is raised.

Now we can demonstrate selective import. For example:

```
target C;
from HelloWorld import SayHello

main reactor Greetings {
    a = new SayHello();
}
```

Finally, renaming can be done by using the `as` predicate:

```
target C;
from HelloWorld import SayHello as SayGreetings

main reactor Greetings {
    a = new SayHeGreetings();
}
```

# Installation

The Lingua Franca toolchain requires Java 17 ([download from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)). Each target language may have additional requirements (see the [Target Language Details](./reference/target-language-details.mdx#requirements) page and select your target language).

You can use Lingua Franca:

- [in Visual Studio Code, using our extension](#visual-studio-code)
- [using Epoch, an Eclipse-based IDE](#epoch-ide)
- [using the command line](#cli-tools)

You can also spin up one of our pre-configured Cloud-based dev environments:

Have a look at the [Lingua Franca playground](https://github.com/lf-lang/playground-lingua-franca) for more details.

## Visual Studio Code

Our Visual Studio Code extension can be installed via the Marketplace or built from source, as detailed below. See the [handbook](./tools/code-extension.mdx) for usage instructions.

### Marketplace

The Lingua Franca extension is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lf-lang.vscode-lingua-franca) and the [VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/lf-lang/vscode-lingua-franca). To install the extension, open VS Code, launch Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and enter:

```
ext install lf-lang.vscode-lingua-franca
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
code --install-extension lf-lang.vscode-lingua-franca
```

To use the nightly pre-release of the extension instead of the latest release, find the Lingua Franca extension in the Extensions tab and click on the "Switch to Pre-Release Version" button.

### From Source

Please refer to the [Lingua Franca VS Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/lf-lang/vscode-lingua-franca) for build instructions.

## Epoch IDE

There are multiple options available for installing Epoch as listed below. See the handbook for usage instructions.

### Install Script

Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest release (on Windows, use WSL):

```
curl -Ls https://install.lf-lang.org | bash -s epoch
```

You can also install the nightly pre-release:

```
curl -Ls https://install.lf-lang.org | bash -s epoch nightly
```

You can use the `--prefix=<path>` argument to change the default install location.

The default prefix is `/usr/local/bin` on a Mac and `~/.local/bin` on Linux and WSL. You may not have write access to this directory by default, in which case, if you still want to use the default prefix, you can replace `sh` with `sudo sh` in the above commands.

### AUR

There are binary packages available in the Arch user repository, which you can install using your favorite AUR helper. For instance, with `yay`:

```
yay -S epoch-bin
```

or for the nightly pre-release:

```
yay -S epoch-nightly-bin
```

### Manual Download

Regular and nightly release builds of Epoch can be downloaded from the [Epoch release page](https://github.com/lf-lang/epoch/releases). Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture, and extract the contents.

MacOS requires extra steps before being able to execute the app:

```
xattr -cr Epoch.app
```

To install, drag the Epoch.app file to your Applications folder. You can then invoke the app as follows:

```
open -a Epoch.app
```

### From Source

Please refer to the [Epoch GitHub repository](https://github.com/lf-lang/epoch) for build instructions.

## CLI Tools

There are multiple options available for installing the Lingua Franca compiler and other command line tools, as listed below. See the [handbook](./tools/command-line-tools.mdx) for usage instructions.

### Install Script

Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest release (on Windows, use WSL):

```
curl -Ls https://install.lf-lang.org | bash -s cli
```

You can also install the nightly pre-release:

```
curl -Ls https://install.lf-lang.org | bash -s cli nightly
```

You can use the `--prefix=<path>` argument to change the default install location.

### AUR

There are binary packages available in the Arch user repository, which you can install using your favorite AUR helper. For instance, with `yay`:

```
yay -S lf-cli-bin
```

or for the nightly pre-release:

```
yay -S lf-cli-nightly-bin
```

### Nix and NixOS

The Lingua Franca compiler is packaged in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-23.11/pkgs/development/compilers/lingua-franca/default.nix#L28) and is available via the binary cache.

Run
```
 nix shell nixpkgs#lingua-franca
```
to temporarily install `lfc` in your current shell environment.

### Manual Download

Regular and nightly release builds of the command line tools can be downloaded from the [Lingua Franca release page](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/releases). Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture, and extract the contents.

### From Source

Please refer to the [Lingua Franca GitHub repository](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca) for build instructions.

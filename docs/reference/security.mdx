:::warning
The experimental security features described on this page are under development and not production ready. Users should not expect their federations will be secure if the `auth` target property is enabled.
:::

By default, there is no secure authentication happening when a federate joins a federation, and data exchanged by federates is not encrypted. For targets that support it, the `auth` target property can be used to enable authentication between federates. Messages exchanged between federates after authentication are **not encrypted**, but this capability is planned for the future.

## Authentication

For the `C` target, federated execution is able to apply security with authentication by using HMAC authentication between RTI and federates. To enable this, include the `auth` property in your target specification, as follows:

```lf-c
target C {
    auth: true
};
```

The RTI build must include CMake options to enable simple HMAC-based authentication of federates. Add `-DAUTH=ON` option to the CMake command as shown below:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DAUTH=ON ../
make
sudo make install
```

If you would like to go back to non-AUTH mode, you would have to remove all contents of the `build` folder.

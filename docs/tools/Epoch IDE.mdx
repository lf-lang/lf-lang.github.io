Epoch is a standalone application based on Eclipse that provides a syntax-directed editor, compiler, and diagram synthesis tool for Lingua Franca programs.

## Usage

By default, Epoch is set to "Build Automatically" in the Project menu. This means that the LF code generator and compiler will be invoked every time you change a file and whenever you open a new project (on all files in the project). Many people prefer to turn this feature off and invoke the code generator by hand by clicking on the gear icon at the upper left.

Epoch is a standalone application based on Eclipse that provides a
syntax-directed editor, compiler, and diagram synthesis tool for Lingua Franca
programs.

## Usage

By default, Epoch is set to "Build Automatically" in the Project menu. This
means that the LF code generator and compiler will be invoked every time you
change a file and whenever you open a new project (on all files in the project).
Many people prefer to turn this feature off and invoke the code generator by
hand by clicking on the gear icon at the upper left.

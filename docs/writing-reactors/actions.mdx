## Action Declaration

An action declaration has one of the following forms:

```lf
  logical action <name>(<min_delay>, <min_spacing>, <policy>)
  physical action <name>(<min_delay>, <min_spacing>, <policy>)
```

The `min_delay`, `min_spacing`, and `policy` are all optional. If only one
argument is given in parentheses, then it is interpreted as an `min_delay`, if
two are given, then they are interpreted as `min_delay` and `min_spacing`. The
`min_delay` and `min_spacing` are time values. The `policy` argument is a string
that can be one of the following: `"defer"` (the default), `"drop"`, or
`"replace"`. Note that the quotation marks are needed.

<ShowOnly c cpp ts rs>

If the action is to carry a payload, then a type must be given as well:

```lf
  logical action <name>(<min_delay>, <min_spacing>, <policy>):<type>
  physical action <name>(<min_delay>, <min_spacing>, <policy>):<type>
```

</ShowOnly>

## Logical Actions

Timers are useful to trigger reactions once or periodically. Actions are used to
trigger reactions more irregularly. An action, like an output or input port, can
carry data, but unlike a port, an action is visible only within the reactor that
defines it.

There are two kinds of actions, **logical** and **physical**. A `logical`
`action` is used by a reactor to schedule a trigger at a fixed logical time
interval _d_ into the future. The time interval _d_, which is called a
**delay**, is relative to the logical time _t_ at which the scheduling occurs.
If a reaction executes at logical time _t_ and schedules an action `a` with
delay _d_, then any reaction that is triggered by `a` will be invoked at logical
time _t_ + _d_. For example, the following reaction schedules something
(printing the current elapsed logical time) 200 msec after an input `x` arrives:

import C_Schedule from "../assets/code/c/src/Schedule.lf";
import Cpp_Schedule from "../assets/code/cpp/src/Schedule.lf";
import Py_Schedule from "../assets/code/py/src/Schedule.lf";
import Rs_Schedule from "../assets/code/rs/src/Schedule.lf";
import TS_Schedule from "../assets/code/ts/src/Schedule.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock
  c={C_Schedule}
  cpp={Cpp_Schedule}
  py={Py_Schedule}
  rs={Rs_Schedule}
  ts={TS_Schedule}
  lf
/>

![Lingua Franca diagram](./../assets/images/diagrams/Schedule.svg)

Here, the delay is specified in the call to schedule within the target language
code. Notice that in the diagram, a logical action is shown as a triangle with
an **L**. Logical actions are always scheduled within a reaction of the reactor
that declares the action.

The time argument is required to be non-negative. If it is zero, then the action
will be scheduled one **microstep** later. See
[Superdense Time](../writing-reactors/superdense-time.mdx).

<ShowIfs>
  <ShowIf c>

    The arguments to the `lf_schedule()` function are the action named `a` and a time. The action `a` has to be declared as an effect of the reaction in order to reference it in the call to `lf_schedule()`. If you fail to declare it as an effect (after the `->` in the reaction signature), then you will get an error message.

    The time argument to the `lf_schedule()` function has data type `interval_t`, which, with the exception of some embedded platforms, is a C `int64_t`. A collection of convenience macros is provided like the `MSEC` macro above to specify time values in a more readable way. The provided macros are `NSEC`, `USEC` (for microseconds), `MSEC`, `SEC`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, and `WEEK`. You may also use the plural of any of these, e.g. `WEEKS(2)`.

    An action may have a data type, in which case, a variant of the `lf_schedule()` function can be used to specify a **payload**, a data value that is carried from where the `lf_schedule()` function is called to the reaction that is triggered by the action. See the [Target Language Details](../reference/target-language-details.mdx).

    The arguments to the `a.schedule()` method is a time. The action `a` has to be
    declared as an effect of the reaction in order to reference it in the body of
    the reaction. If you fail to declare it as an effect (after the `->` in the
    reaction signature), then you will get a runtime error message.

    The time argument to the `a.schedule()` method expects an integer. A collection
    of convenience functions is provided like the `MSEC` function above to specify
    time values in a more readable way. The provided functions are `NSEC`, `USEC`
    (for microseconds), `MSEC`, `SEC`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, and `WEEK`. You may
    also use the plural of any of these, e.g. `WEEKS(2)`.

    An action may carry data, in which case, the **payload** data value is just given as a second argument to the `.schedule()` method. See the [Target Language Details](../reference/target-language-details.mdx).

  </ShowIf>
  <ShowIf ts>

    The `schedule()` method of an action takes two arguments, a `TimeValue` and an (optional) payload. If a payload is given and a type is given for the action, then the type of the payload must match the type of the action. See the [Target Language Details](../reference/target-language-details.mdx) for details.

## Physical Actions

A `physical` `action` is used to schedule reactions at logical times determined
by the local physical clock. If a physical action with delay _d_ is scheduled at
_physical_ time _T_, then the _logical time_ assigned to the event is _T_ + _d_.
For example, the following reactor schedules the physical action `p` to trigger
at a **logical time** equal to the **physical time** at which the input `x`
arrives:

import C_Physical from "../assets/code/c/src/Physical.lf";
import Cpp_Physical from "../assets/code/cpp/src/Physical.lf";
import Py_Physical from "../assets/code/py/src/Physical.lf";
import Rs_Physical from "../assets/code/rs/src/Physical.lf";
import TS_Physical from "../assets/code/ts/src/Physical.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock
  c={C_Physical}
  cpp={Cpp_Physical}
  py={Py_Physical}
  rs={Rs_Physical}
  ts={TS_Physical}
  lf
/>

![Lingua Franca diagram](./../assets/images/diagrams/Physical.svg)

If you drive this with a timer, using for example the following structure:

![Lingua Franca diagram](./../assets/images/diagrams/PhysicalTest.svg)

then running the program will yield an output something like this:

```
Action triggered at logical time 201491000 nsec after start.
Action triggered at logical time 403685000 nsec after start.
Action triggered at logical time 603669000 nsec after start.
...
```

Here, logical time is lagging physical time by a few milliseconds. Note that,
unless the [fast option](../introduction.md#fast) is given, logical time _t_
chases physical time _T_, so _t_ < _T_. Hence, the event being scheduled in the
reaction to input `x` is assured of being in the future in logical time.

Whereas logical actions are required to be scheduled within a reaction of the
reactor that declares the action, physical actions can be scheduled by code that
is outside the Lingua Franca system. For example, some other thread or a
callback function may call `schedule()`, passing it a physical action. For
example:

import C_Asynchronous from "../assets/code/c/src/Asynchronous.lf";
import Cpp_Asynchronous from "../assets/code/cpp/src/Asynchronous.lf";
import Py_Asynchronous from "../assets/code/py/src/Asynchronous.lf";
import Rs_Asynchronous from "../assets/code/rs/src/Asynchronous.lf";
import TS_Asynchronous from "../assets/code/ts/src/Asynchronous.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock
  c={C_Asynchronous}
  cpp={Cpp_Asynchronous}
  py={Py_Asynchronous}
  rs={Rs_Asynchronous}
  ts={TS_Asynchronous}
  lf
/>

import AsynchronousSVG from "./../assets/images/diagrams/Asynchronous.svg";

<AsynchronousSVG
  title="Lingua Franca diagram: Asynchronous"
  role="img"
  width="350"
/>

Physical actions are the mechanism for obtaining input from the outside world.
Because they are assigned a logical time derived from the physical clock, their
logical time can be interpreted as a measure of the time at which some external
event occurred.

<ShowOnly c>

In the above example, at `startup`, the main reactor creates an external thread
that schedules a physical action roughly every 200 msec.

First, the [file-level `preamble`](../writing-reactors/preambles.mdx) has
`#include "platform.h"`, which includes the declarations for functions it uses,
`lf_sleep` and `lf_thread_create` (see
[Libraries Available to Programmers](../reference/target-language-details.mdx#libraries-available-to-programmers)).

Second, the thread uses a function `lf_sleep()`, which abstracts
platform-specific mechanisms for stalling the thread for a specified amount of
time, and `lf_thread_create()`, which abstracts platform-specific mechanisms for
creating threads.

The `external` function executed by the thread is defined in a reactor-level
`preamble` section. See [Preambles](../writing-reactors/preambles.mdx).

## Triggering Time for Actions

An action will trigger at a logical time that depends on the arguments given to
the schedule function, the `<min_delay>`, `<min_spacing>`, and `<policy>`
arguments in the action declaration, and whether the action is physical or
logical.

For a `logical` action `a`, the tag assigned to the event resulting from a call
to `schedule()` is computed as follows. First, let _t_ be the _current logical
time_. For a logical action, _t_ is just the logical time at which the reaction
calling `schedule()` is called. The **preliminary time** of the action is then
just _t_ + `<min_delay>` + `<offset>`. This preliminary time may be further
modified, as explained below.

For a **physical** action, the preliminary time is similar, except that _t_ is
replaced by the current _physical_ time _T_ when `schedule()` is called.

If a `<min_spacing>` has been declared, then it gives a minimum logical time
interval between the tags of two subsequently scheduled events. If the
preliminary time is closer than `<min_spacing>` to the time of the previously
scheduled event (if there is one), then `<policy>` (if supported by the target)
determines how the minimum spacing constraint is enforced. Note that "previously
scheduled" here means specifically the tag resulting from the most recent call
to `lf_schedule` for the same action.

:::warning

Since calls to `lf_schedule`
can specify arbitrary extra delays, `<min_spacing>` does not necessarily result
in events with minimum spacing between them. If your calls to `lf_schedule`
result in monotonically increasing tags, however, you will get events with
minimum spacing between them.

:::

<ShowIfs>
<ShowIf c py>

The `<policy>` is one of the following:

- `"defer"`: (**the default**) The event is added to the event queue with a tag
  that is equal to earliest time that satisfies the minimal spacing requirement.
  Assuming the time of the preceding event is _t_prev_, then the tag of the new
  event simply becomes _t_prev_ + `<min_spacing>`.
- `"drop"`: The new event is dropped and `schedule()` returns without having
  modified the event queue.
- `"replace"`: The payload (if any) of the new event is assigned to the
  preceding event if it is still pending in the event queue; no new event is
  added to the event queue in this case. If the preceding event has already been
  pulled from the event queue, the default `"defer"` policy is applied.

Note that while the `"defer"` policy is conservative in the sense that it does
not discard events, it could potentially cause an unbounded growth of the event
queue.

> The `<policy>` argument is currently not supported.

</ShowIf>
</ShowIfs>

## Testing an Action for Presence

{/* This looks like crap but what can you do? */} When a reaction is triggered
by more than one action or by an action and an input, it may be necessary to
test within the reaction whether the action is present. Just like for inputs,
this can be done in the <ShowOnly c inline>C target with
`a->is_present`</ShowOnly>

{" "}

<ShowOnly cpp inline>

C++ target with `a.is_present()`

<ShowOnly ts inline>

TypeScript target with `a != undefined`

<ShowOnly rs inline>

Rust target with `ctx.is_present(a)`

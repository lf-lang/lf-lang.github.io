## Generic Reactors

Sometimes it is useful to implement a generic pattern without knowing the
concrete types used. For instance, it could be useful to implement a delay
reactor that forwards all values it receives with a fixed delay, regardless of
their datatype. For this pattern, it is not required to know the concrete type
in advance, and we would like to reuse the same logic for different types. This
can be achieved with generic reactors in LF. Consider the following example:

import C_GenericDelay from "../assets/code/c/src/GenericDelay.lf";
import Cpp_GenericDelay from "../assets/code/cpp/src/GenericDelay.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock c={C_GenericDelay} cpp={Cpp_GenericDelay} lf />

The example above defines a generic reactor `Delay` which has a type parameter
named `T`. Its input, output and logical action are all of type `T`. The logic
implemented in the reactions is straightforward. The reaction to `in` schedules
the logical action `a` with the configured delay and the received value. The
reaction to `a` simply forwards this value to the output port at a later tag.
The concrete type `T`, however, is not relevant for this implementation and will
be filled in only when the reactor is instantiated. In our example, the main
reactor instantiates `Delay`, specifying `int` as the type to be assigned to
`T`. As a consequence, we can set an integer on `d`'s input port and receive an
integer on its output. If we wanted instead to delay a string, we can do this as
follows:

import C_GenericString from "../assets/code/c/src/GenericString.lf";
import Cpp_GenericString from "../assets/code/cpp/src/GenericString.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock c={C_GenericString} cpp={Cpp_GenericString} lf />

Reactor definitions may also specify multiple type parameters. Moreover, type
parameters are not limited to ports and actions, but can also be used in state
variables, parameters, or methods. For instance, we can define the following
reactor:

```lf
reactor Generic<T, U, V>(bar: T) {
  state baz: U

  input in: V

  method (x: T, y: U): V {= /* ... */ =}
}
```

This reactor could be instantiated for example like this:

```lf
g = new Generic<float, int, bool>()
```

## Extending a Base Reactor

Lingua Franca supports defining a reactor class as an extension (or subclass),
as in the following example:

import C_Extends from "../assets/code/c/src/Extends.lf";
import Py_Extends from "../assets/code/py/src/Extends.lf";
import Rs_Extends from "../assets/code/rs/src/Extends.lf";
import TS_Extends from "../assets/code/ts/src/Extends.lf";

<NoSelectorTargetCodeBlock
  c={C_Extends}
  py={Py_Extends}
  rs={Rs_Extends}
  ts={TS_Extends}
  lf
/>

import ExtendsSVG from "./../assets/images/diagrams/Extends.svg";

<ExtendsSVG title="Lingua Franca diagram: Extends" role="img" width="350" />

Here, the base class `A` has a single output that it writes to in reaction to an
input. The subclass inherits the input, the output, and the reaction of `A`, and
adds its own input `b` and reaction. When an input event `a` arrives, both
reactions will be invoked, but, once again, in a well-defined order. The
reactions of the base class are invoked before those of the derived class. So in
this case, `B` will overwrite the output produced by `A`.

One limitation is that a subclass cannot have ports, actions, or state variables
with the same names as those in the base class. The names must be unique.

A subclass can extend more than one base class by just providing a
comma-separated list of base classes. If reactions in multiple base classes are
triggered at the same tag, they will be invoked in the same order that they
appear in the comma-separated list.

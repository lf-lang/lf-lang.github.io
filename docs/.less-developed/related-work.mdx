Lingua Franca is focused more on using the best ideas than on being innovative.
Here, we list most closely related work first, then other work with which it may
be useful to contrast.

## Software Frameworks

- [Rubus](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10270-020-00795-5).

- [Akka framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X20330739)
  for distributed Fog computing.

- [Accessors](http://accessors.org), from Berkeley, a JavaScript-based framework
  for IoT: This framework is the most direct inspiration for Lingua Franca. The
  idea behind accessors is to componentize IoT resources by encapsulating them
  in actors. As such, their interactions can be coordinated under a discrete
  event semantics [paper](http://www.icyphy.org/pubs/75.html).

- [Rebecca](https://rebeca-lang.org).

- The
  [Kiel Integrated Environment for Layout Eclipse Rich Client](https://www.rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/research/kieler/welcome-to-the-kieler-project)
  (**KIELER**) is a graphical environment for programming using
  [SCCharts](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/confluence/display/KIELER/SCCharts)
  (see the [2014 PLDI paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2594291.2594310)).

- **[RTMAPS](https://intempora.com/products/rtmaps#about-rtmaps)**: From
  Intempora. It has a graphical syntax in a UI and advertises "data is acquired
  asynchronously and each data sample is captured along with its time stamp at
  its own pace." You can build your own blocks in C++ or Python. It does,
  however, look like its not deterministic.

### Usage of the Term Reactor

- **[reactors.io](http://reactors.io/)**: This project, from EPFL, originally
  used the term "reactive isolates" in a
  [2015 paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2814228.2814245). In 2016,
  Prokopec changed the name "reactive isolates" to "reactors" (see
  [2018 paper](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00302-9_5)). They claim their
  reactors are "actors done right," but they remain nondeterministic. See a
  [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lulYWWD4Qo).

- [Racket implementation of ReactiveML](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reactor/index.html)

- **FIXME** https://projectreactor.io/ based on http://www.reactive-streams.org/

### Other Pointers

- **[Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)**: Version 2.0,
  Published in 2014, this position paper defines Reactive Systems as those that
  are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven.

## Academic Projects

- [I/O Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%2Foutput_automaton), from
  MIT, is a formalism that could be used to model the semantics of Lingua
  Franca. Timed I/O Automata FIXME: link extend I/O Automata with temporal
  semantics. They share with LF the notion of reactions to input messages and
  internal events that change the state of an actor and produce outputs. The
  behavior of a component is given as a state machine.

- **FIXME** Hewitt actors.

- **SyncCharts**: By Charles Andr√©. See the
  [1996 technical report](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Charles.Andre/CA%20Publis/SYNCCHARTS/overview.html).

- **ReactiveML**: [Website](http://reactiveml.org)

## Contrasting Work

- [CAPH](http://caph.univ-bpclermont.fr/CAPH/CAPH.html) (a recursive acronym for
  CAPH Ain't plain HDL), a hardware description language from CNRS, is a
  fine-grained dataflow language for compiling into FPGAs. The language has no
  temporal semantics, and although it has a notion of firing rules, it is not
  clear which of the many variants of dataflow is realized nor whether the MoC
  is deterministic. The
  [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6972018) does
  not cite any of the prior work on dataflow MoCs.

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System),
  an open-source project originally from
  [Willow Garage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Garage): ROS provides a
  publish-and-subscribe server for interaction between components. Version 1 has
  no timing properties at all. Version 2 has some timing properties such as
  priorities, but it makes no effort to be deterministic.

- [RADLER framework](https://sri-csl.github.io/radler/) from SRI, which is based
  on a publish-and-subscribe architecture similar to ROS. It introduces some
  timing constructs such as periodic execution and scheduling constraints, but
  it makes no effort to be deterministic.
